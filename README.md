**Built a Nested Sidebar + Breadcrumb Nav in React!** ⚛️

🎯 **What’s working now:**

📂 Collapsible Sidebar with Nested Sections
🧭 Dynamic Breadcrumb Trail (`Control Flow > if-else > Nested if`)

🔜 **What’s next?**
🔗 Clickable breadcrumbs
🎨 Smooth animations & better transitions

Loving how flexible React is for building intuitive documentation systems.
